<h2>Hermes</h2>
<p>
  Hermes (/ˈhɜːrmiːz/; Greek: Ἑρμῆς) is a deity in Ancient Greek religion and mythology. Hermes is considered as the herald of the gods, as well as the protector of human heralds, travellers, thieves,[1] merchants, and orators, respectively.[2][3] He is able to move freely between the worlds of the mortal and the divine, playing the role of the psychopomp or "soul guide" — a conductor of souls into the afterlife.[4][5]

In myth, Hermes functioned as the emissary and messenger of the gods,[6] and was often presented as the son of Zeus and Maia, the Pleiad. Just as well, he is regarded as "the divine trickster,"[7] for which Homer offers the most popular account in his Hymn to Hermes.[8]

His attributes and symbols include the herma, the rooster, the tortoise, satchel or pouch, winged sandals, and winged cap, as well as the palm tree, goat, the number four, several kinds of fish, and incense.[9] However, his main symbol is the caduceus, a winged staff intertwined with two snakes copulating and carvings of the other gods.[10] His attributes had previously influenced the earlier Etruscan god Turms, a name borrowed from the Greek "herma".[11]

In Roman tradition, Hermes was known as Mercury,[12] a name derived from the Latin merx, meaning "merchandise," and from where we get the words "merchant" and "commerce."[13]
